            <h3>7.	General Conditions </h3>
            <p>In the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Contest is impaired in any way for any reason, including, but not limited to fraud, technical problems, security malfunctions or in the event the Contest is unable to run as planned for any other reason, as determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion, Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either: (1) suspend the Contest to address the impairment and then resume in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Rules; or (2) terminate the Contest and, in the event of termination, no participant shall be eligible for a Reward of any type.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Sponsor reserves the right in its sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the operation of the Contest or to be acting in violation of these Rules or in a disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to damage the website or undermine the legitimate operation of the Contest may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages (including attorneys fees) and any other remedies from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. Failure by Sponsor to enforce any provision of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. 
                 Participating individuals have been advised of the existence of Section 1542 of the California Civil Code which provides: 
            </p>
            <p>A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR. </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, entry and participation in the Contest shall constitute a full release of liability in accordance with its terms. 
                Each Participating party knowingly and voluntarily waives the provisions of Section 1542, as well as any other statute, law or rule of similar effect, and acknowledge and agree that this waiver is an essential and material term of these Rules and that without such waiver, Sponsor would not have accepted the entry. 
            </p>        

            <h3>8.	Release and Limitations of Liability </h3>
            <p>By participating in the Contest, you agree to release and hold harmless Sponsor, and each of its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, advertising and promotion agencies, other companies associated with the Contest, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, representatives, and agents (together, “Released Parties”) from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Contest or receipt of a Reward, including, but not limited to: (a) any technical errors associated with the Contest, including lost, interrupted or unavailable Internet Service Provider (ISP), network, server, or wireless service provider; (b) unauthorized human intervention in the Contest; (c) mechanical human, printing or typographical errors; or (d) injury, death, losses or damages of any kind, to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from your participation in the Contest or acceptance, receipt or misuse of any Reward you may receive. You further agree that in any cause of action, the Released Parties’ liability will be limited to the cost of entering and participating in the Contest, and in no event shall the entrant be entitled to receive attorney’s fees. Released Parties are also not responsible for any incorrect or inaccurate information, whether caused by site users, tampering, hacking, or by any equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Contest. </p>

            <h3>9.	Privacy & Information Submitted </h3>
            <p>As a condition of entering the Contest, you give consent for Sponsor to obtain and deliver his or her name, address and other information to third parties for the purpose of administering this Contest and to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules. Any information you provide to Sponsor may be used to communicate with you in relation to this Contest or on a Contest Winner’s list. Information submitted in connection with the Project will be treated in accordance with the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy. </p>

            <h3>10.	Miscellaneous. </h3>
            <p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Rules or the prize acceptance documents will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision of the Rules is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein. Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term of these Rules will not constitute a waiver of that provision. You agree to waive any rights to claim ambiguity of these Rules. Headings are solely for convenience of reference and will not be deemed to affect in any manner the meaning or intent of the documents or any provision hereof. In the event there is a discrepancy or inconsistency between disclosures or other statements contained in any Contest-related materials, privacy policy or terms of use on the Site and/or the terms and conditions of the Rules, the Rules shall prevail, govern and control. </p>

            <h3>11.	Arbitration. </h3>
            <p>These Rules shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of New Jersey, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules, which would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than New Jersey. Except where prohibited, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of, or connected with, the Contest or any Reward awarded shall be resolved by binding arbitration, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by the appropriate court located in New Jersey. The parties agree to follow the arbitration procedures set forth by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to resolve the dispute. Arbitration proceedings shall take place in the State of New Jersey. Each party is responsible for paying its own filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. </p>
